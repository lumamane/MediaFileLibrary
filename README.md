This Project allows you to 
upload, 
organize
and consume your media files (with one click)  
in your own local "cloud".

You can run this media file server, whereever node.js runs:
desktop, 
laptop, 
raspberry pi, 
even on a Android device (using termux) for a "mobile" cloud.

Access your media files from any device in the same network.
Very helpful, if you have files on several devices, you would want to have in one place.

Collect and enjoy everything (you can open directly in your browser):
pdf
txt
fotos
videos
html (documents ore single-filed tools)
epub (books)
    Chrome: You can use extensions like "EPUBReader" or "Readium" which allow you to open and read EPUB files directly in your browser.
    Firefox: Similar extensions are available for Firefox as well.
