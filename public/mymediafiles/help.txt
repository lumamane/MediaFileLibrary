it makes sense to upload only files you can open in a browser.

pdf
txt
fotos
videos
html (documents ore single-filed tools):

epub (books)
    Chrome: You can use extensions like "EPUBReader" or "Readium" which allow you to open and read EPUB files directly in your browser.
    Firefox: Similar extensions are available for Firefox as well.
